# Introduction to Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing 

Defn:unintended and unsolicited installation of software on a system without the user knowing or wanting it.

## Types of Malware

### Virus 

 - Malicious software (malware) designed to spread from one device to another.
• infect program and perform some unwanted function.
• Some are easy to detect and remove from a system.
• whereas others are very difficult to detect and remove.
• Some viruses use polymorphic (changing) technology to morph as they move
from system to system, thereby prolonging their detection.

#### Characteristics

• Replication: A virus can replicate itself by attaching to other programs or files.
• Activation: It requires execution by the user (e.g., opening an infected file) to activate.
• Payload: The destructive part of the virus, which might delete files, alter data, or perform other
malicious activities.
• Infection Mechanism: Viruses spread through infected files, emails, removable drives, or
compromised websites

### Trojan Horse
 
Type of malicious software that disguises itself as a legitimate or harmless program to deceive
users into installing or executing it.
• Trojan does not self-replicate. Instead, it relies on the victim to activate it, often through social
engineering tactics. 

#### Characteristics

• Deceptive Appearance: It appears to be a useful or benign file or program (e.g., a game,
software update, or email attachment).
• Hidden Payload: Once executed, it performs malicious activities such as stealing data, installing
additional malware, or allowing unauthorized access to the system.
• No Self-Replication: Unlike viruses or worms, a Trojan does not spread on its own.
