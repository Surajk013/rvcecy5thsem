# Automata Theory

## Alphabets
> 1. Finite set of symbols
  2. Represented as sigma [right angled M thingy]
  ex: sigma={0,1} 

## String
> 1. Finite sequence of symbols/alphabets
  2. w,x,y,z
  ex: w=01011

    ### Empty String
    - string with zero symbols
    - represented by epsilong

    ### Length of a string
    - number of symbols in the string
    - length of w is |w|

### Example

sigma = {0,1}
w = 01011, |w|=|01011|  = '5'
w = epsilon, |w| = 0

## Powers of an Alphabets
sigma to power k is the set of strings of length  k chosen form  sigma

sigma to power 0 = {epsilon}

binary alphabet , sigma = {0,1}
sigma raised to 1 =  {0,1}
sigma raised to 2 = {00,11,10,01}
sigam raised to 3 = {000,111,010,10...}

#### set of all strings over an alphabet
sigma raised to star = 
{0,1} raised to star
