# Planning

Planning is concerned with both what an organization wants to accomplish (ends) and how it will achieve these aims (means). Formal planning, the type of planning focused on here, involves:␍
●	Defining specific goals that cover a certain time frame. 
●	Writing and sharing goals with all members of the organization. This reduces ambiguity and promotes a shared understanding of goals.
●	Formulating plans for achieving the established goals.



## Advantages

- Provides Direction
- reduced uncertainity
- Minimizes waste and redundancy 
- Establishes Controls standards


> **means-ends chain** Effectively designed organizational goals fit into a hierarchy so that the achievement of goals at low levels permits the attainment of high‐level goals. This process is called a means‐ends chain because low‐level goals lead to accomplishment of high‐level goals.

# Types of Planning

long term - short term = time
single use - standing = frequencyt of use 
directional - specific = Specificity
strategic - opetaional = Breadth

# Goals

## Types of goal setting

- strategic 
- performance 
- learning
- process
- outcome 
- social/ impact goal setting




# Organisational structure and design 

**Organizing** : arranging and structuring work to accomplish an organization goals. 

**Departmentalization** : After deciding what job tasks will be done by whom, common work activities need to be grouped back together so work gets done in a coordinated and integrated way. How jobs are grouped together is called departmentalization
 remember segregation 
   - functional departmentalisation 
   - geographical departmentalisation
   - products
   - process 

### Chain of command 


**Authority**

**Responsibility**

**uninty of command**



### Span of control

### Centralisatoin and decentralisation

 Centralization is the degree to which decision making takes place at upper levels of the organization. If top managers make key decisions with little input from below, then the organization is more centralized. On the other hand, the more that lower-level employees provide input or actually make decisions, the more decentralization there is.

> It is not an **either-or** concept so one company can be both centralised and decentralised


**Formalization** : Formalization refers to how standardized an organization’s jobs are and the extent to which employee behavior is guided by rules and procedures. In highly formalized organizations, there are explicit job descriptions, numerous organizational rules, and clearly defined procedures covering work processes. Employees have little discretion over what’s done, when it’s done, and how it’s done.
